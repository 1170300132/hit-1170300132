How to contribute.

(1)Did you find a bug?

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issueï¼Œincluding:
Active Record (models, database) issues
Action Pack (controllers, routing) issues
Generic template for other issues

(2)Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

(3)Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

(4)Do you have questions about the source code?

Ask any question about how to use it in the mailing list.

Thanks!
